    <strong><h1  style="text-align: center">Two examples of the different styles of modern poetry </h1></strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>The poetic story</h2>
    <strong><p>In this section we will refer to an example of a text in the form of a poetic story citing a contemporary artist with a marked protest tendency.</p></strong>
    <p>"De-constructing the metric"</p>
    <p> Coming from anywhere, on one of those nights when I find myself, looking at myself from a body that is
        not me, I felt insatiable.
        Every light in that place reminded me of a past moment. The lost gazes and the bodies consuming
        everything we tie ourselves to in order to disappear
        for a while from our colorless lives, without a doubt, had been my own reflection for years and more
        years of not wanting
        to understand myself, believing that I understood myself, me and those who understood me. they
        surrounded.</p>
    <p>
        And now, that the event that changed things had happened, the picture was incomparable and I did not feel part
        of any of the hundreds
        of scenes that surrounded that silly music club.
        The systems, consumerism, television and its idealizations had made my generation believe that it gained its
        senses by understanding love,
        the earth and needs but that it lost in concepts of self-help, uncovering the terrible depression that we suffer
        in masses of hundreds.
    </p>

    <p>
        At the end of the day, another cycle repeats itself, another new generation begins and another end of things
        becomes noticeable and no one knows who alters it
        and no one knows who starts the wars that we spend so much time defending with so many convictions.
        At the end of the day a few concepts move the world but the world itself already represents a pattern and free
        will is assumed to become an ideal,
        illogical model, kept in some drawer of the giant chest of deprivations of rights and,
    </p>

    <p>
        Going back to what I was trying to say, my generation only has time to live
        because minutes last so little and there is so little option that running seems like a perfect plan.
    </p>
<h2>The poetry in verse</h2>
<p>In this section we will present an example of a romantic poem with a tendency towards the generality of being. Illusions in reality and a little meter in song</p>
<p>
    If you wake me up<br>
    between your kisses,<br>
    the bed looks like heaven
    and you the dawn<br>
    Because they are my heartbeats<br>
    living angels,
    that are reborn under your skin<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The poetry that hides<br>
    In your mind I undress myself,<br>
    It ties me to the heights.<br>
    You please me and heal me,<br>
    with tenderness,<br>
    with your absurd way of being<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Wanna<br>
    Savor you slowly,<br>
    Know your moles,<br>
    The moon of your mornings,<br>
    And the cold in your places,<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    enter and heal your duels,<br>
    enter and embrace your fears,
    come in to look and take care,<br>
    to sow and listen<br>
    what your skies say...<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    If you exist as a deep truth<br>
    and you are not made of lies,<br>
    If I could be me without fear of breaking,<br>
    If playing is not bad and I don't want to run,<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    if you watch me slowly<br>
    like someone who doesn't understand<br>
    and you don't assume the simple<br>
    and don't kill my faith<br>
    "Stay "<br>

        I hope there will always be someone who knows how to listen to the silences(...)"
